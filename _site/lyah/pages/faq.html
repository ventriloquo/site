<p>Sure, it’s licensed under a
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/" rel="nofollow">creative commons</a> license, so you can share and change
this, as long as you do it with a smile on your face and for
non-commercial purposes.</p>

<h2 id="do-you-recommend-any-other-haskell-reading-material">Do you recommend any other Haskell reading material?</h2>

<p>There are loads of awesome tutorials out there, but I’d just like to
point out how great
<a href="http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/" rel="nofollow">Real
World Haskell</a> is. It’s really great. I feel it complements this
tutorial nicely. This tutorial focuses mainly on using simple examples
to ease beginners into learning Haskell, whereas Real World Haskell
really shows you how to do useful stuff with it.</p>

<p>Another great Haskell resource is
<a href="http://tryhaskell.org" rel="nofollow">Try Haskell</a>, which
allows you to try Haskell right in your browser and offers a rad
interactive walkthrough.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-get-in-touch-with-you">How do I get in touch with you?</h2>

<p>The best way would be to shoot me an email to bonus at learnyouahaskell
dot com. I kinda suck at email though, so please, please don’t be mad if
I don’t reply in a timely fashion!</p>

<h2 id="your-book-is-cool-but-i-want-some-exercises-too">Your book is cool but I want some exercises too!</h2>

<p>Coming soon! A lot of people have been asking me to add exercises, so
I’ll be putting some up soonish.</p>

<h2 id="tell-me-about-yourself">Tell me about yourself!</h2>

<p>My name is Miran Lipovača, I reside in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Most of my
time is spent on doing nothing in particular, but when I’m not doing
nothing I’m either programming, drawing, boxing or playing bass. I even
have a cool <a href="http://www.bigbasstabs.com">bass tabs</a> site. I also have a
collection of stuffed owls and sometimes I talk to them and they talk
back.</p>
